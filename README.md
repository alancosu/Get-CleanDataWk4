This is a tidy dataset created for an John Hopkins Data Science course through R on Coursera.

Using data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset [1], downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The data has been tidied to give average values for the measurements for each of 30 subjects by listed activity type.

The analysis was performed in the script given in run_analysis.R and the resulting tidy data set structure is given in CodeBook.md.
